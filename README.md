# AI-Powered Web Test Automation (Selenium + Prompt)

This project demonstrates AI-driven test automation for websites using Selenium, Python, and prompt interpretation. The tests are structured based on natural language test steps, parsed by AI, and executed on the browser.

## Structure

- `tests/`: Contains test case implementations
- `ai_parser/`: Handles parsing of natural language prompts
- `reports/`: Contains test output (logs, Excel, etc.)
